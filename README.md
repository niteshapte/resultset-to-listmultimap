resultset-to-listmultimap
=========================

Convert ResultSet into ListMultiMap in Java

This will give developers a clear visibility regarding the column names and the values associated with them and also will help to retrieve values when performing iteration.

I understand, something like this can be achieved using HashMap but I will suggest to use ListMultiMap as it is more memory efficient. 

Checkout the code.
